# Advent of Code 2025

Repository for storing the code for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025). 

Rules I impose on myself:
1. Code must not be generated via A.I.
2. When I get stuck for a prolonged amount of time, I can go to reddit for help for hints. But I am not allowed to copy-paste code.
3. Same goes for YouTube. 

Goal is to solve fun programming exercises to improve my coding skills.
